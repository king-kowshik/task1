In 1982, at the age of 22, Balakrishna married Vasundhara Devi, and they have three children.[19]</p>

Produced by Pusapati Lakshmipati Raju, the film was announced to have an ensemble cast also featuring Soundarya, Srihari, Saikumar, Uday Kiran and Asin in lead roles.[28] However, despite a grand launch, the film was later shelved following the sudden demise of Soundarya.[29]

Raghavendra Rao. He played the dual roles of Krishna and Panduranga.[31] Rediff described his performance as "Balakrishna does justice to both the roles of God and Ranga. He shines in the climax of the movie. It's quite a task to step into NTR's shoes, but his son has done pretty well, though one does miss NTR in the role of Krishna!".[32] The film was an average success and his performance won him the Santosham Best Actor Award.[33] In the year 2009, he starred in the family drama Mitrudu, alongside Priyamani in a slightly different role – that of a dependable friend and confidante to the female lead. The film opened to average reviews.[34]

The film opened to positive reviews,[35] and went on to become the highest-grossing Telugu film of the year.[36] A review in Rediff said about his performance: "Balakrishna has put in a restrained performance. Though his character is supposed to roar at times, he seems subdued most of the time. But he's given plenty to be pleased about as it is his show all the way."[37] In 2011, he acted in the mythological film Sri Rama Rajyam, based on the epic Ramayana. He played a triple role in the 2012 action drama Adhinayakudu as grandfather, father and grandson.
